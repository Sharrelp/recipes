# Peanut Butter Chocolate Pillows

Makes 2 dozen cookies.

### Chocolate dough:

* 1/2 c. canola oil (vegetable oil is fine, too)
* 1 c. sugar
* 1/4 c. pure maple syrup
* 3 tbsp. non-dairy milk
* 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1 1/2 c. all-purpose flour
* 1/3 c. unsweetened dutch processed cocoa powder
* 2 tbsp. black unsweetened cocoa or more dutch processed unsweetened
  cocoa powder
* 1/2 tsp. baking soda
* 1/4 tsp. salt

### Filling:

* 3/4 c. natural salted peanut butter, crunchy or creamy style
* 2/3 c. confectioner's sugar
* 2-3 tbsp. soy creamer or non-dairy milk
* 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract

In a large mixing bowl combine oil, sugar, maple syrup, non-dairy milk
and vanilla extract and mix until smooth. Sift in flour, cocoa powder,
black cocoa if using, baking soda and salt. Mix to form a moist dough.

Make the filling. In another mixing bowl beat together peanut butter,
confectioner’s sugar, 2 tablespoons of soy creamer and vanilla extract
to form a moist but firm dough. If peanut butter dough is too dry (as
different natural peanut butters have different moisture content),
stir in remaining tablespoon of non-dairy milk. If dough is too wet
knead in a little extra powdered sugar.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Line bakings sheet with parchment paper.

Shape the cookies. Create the centers of the cookies by rolling the
peanut butter dough into 24 balls. Scoop a generous tablespoon of
chocolate dough, flatten into a disc and place a peanut butter ball in
the center. Fold the sides of the chocolate dough up and around the
peanut butter center and roll the chocolate ball into an smooth ball
between your palms. Place on a sheet of waxed paper and repeat with
remaining doughs. If desired gently flatten cookies a little, but this
is not necessary.

Place dough balls on lined baking sheets about 2 inches apart and bake
for 10 minutes. Remove sheet from oven and let cookies for 5 minutes
before moving to a wire rack to complete cooling. Store cookies in
tightly covered container. If desired warm cookies in a microwave for
10 to 12 seconds before serving.

# Thai Green Coconut Curry

* 1 can unsweetened coconut milk
* 4 ounces green beans
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1 lime
* 1 yellow onion
* 1 sweet potato (optional)
* 1 bunch cilantro (optional)
* 3 tablespoons cashews (optional)
* 2 tablespoons green curry paste
* 1-inch piece ginger
* 1 can of bamboo shoots
* 1 carton of mushrooms

Wash and dry the fresh produce. Peel and mince the garlic and
ginger. Peel and thinly slice the onion. Peel and medium dice the
sweet potato. Using a peeler, remove the green rind of the lime,
avoiding the white pith; mince the rind to get 2 teaspoons of zest (or
use a zester). Quarter the lime. Roughly chop the cashews. Trim off
and discard the stem ends of the green beans; halve crosswise. Pick
the cilantro leaves off the stems; discard the stems.

In a large pot, heat 2 teaspoons of oil on medium until hot. Add the
garlic and ginger; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring
frequently, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until softened and
fragrant. Add as much of the curry paste as you’d like, depending on
how spicy you’d like the dish to be. Cook, stirring frequently, 30
seconds to 1 minute, or until the curry paste is toasted and fragrant.

Add the onion and sweet potato to the pot; season with salt. (If the
pot seems dry, add 1 teaspoon of oil.) Cook, stirring frequently, 4 to
6 minutes, or until the onion has softened. Stir in the lime zest,
coconut milk (shaking the can before opening) and 3/4 cup of water.
Add bamboo shoots and mushroom.

Simmer, stirring occasionally, 6 to 8 minutes, or until the sweet
potato is tender.

While the curry simmers, toast the cashews in a small dry pan on
medium heat, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until lightly
browned and fragrant. Transfer to a small bowl.

Add the green beans to the pot of curry. Simmer 1 to 3 minutes, or
until the green beans are slightly tender. Remove from heat and stir
in the juice of 2 lime wedges; season with salt and pepper to
taste. Divide the finished curry between 2 bowls; top with the cooked
rice. Garnish with the toasted cashews, cilantro and remaining lime
wedges.

Serve with rice.

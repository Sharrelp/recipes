# Lentil Soup

- 2 tbsp. olive oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 1-2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2-4 red bell peppers, diced
- 2 large cans diced tomatoes
- 4 c. vegetable broth
- 2 large bay leaves
- 1 tbsp. cayenne
- 1 large can lentils, rinsed
- 2 large cans any kind of bean, rinsed
- 2 tbsp. balsamic vinegar
- Bunch of kale, spinach, or chard, chopped

In a large pot, heat oil over medium. Add diced onions and cook 2 minutes to
soften. Add garlic and cook another minute. Add diced red peppers and cook 5
minutes, stirring often. Add canned tomatoes, continuing to cook and stir.

Add remaining ingredients. Stir, turn down heat, and simmer 20 minutes.

Remove bay leaves. Take a stick blender and roughly puree about 1/3 of the pot
just to make it a bit smoother but leaving lots of chunks.

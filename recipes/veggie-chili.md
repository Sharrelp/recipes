# Veggie Chili

- an onion
- some garlic
- bag of veggie faux-meat (the Morningstar Farms "Grillers Crumbles" are pretty good)
- big can of chopped tomatoes
- big can of black beans
- chili powder to taste
- salt and pepper to taste
- cayenne pepper to taste

Chop the onion and garlic, and fry 'em up in some olive oil. Once the onion's
transparent, add the other ingredients, and cook until they look about right.

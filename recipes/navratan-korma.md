# Navratan Korma

- 2 medium onions, finely chopped
- 3 tbsp. canola oil
- 3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
- 1 tsp. fresh grated ginger
- 1/4 tsp. cardamom
- 1/2 tsp. cinnamon
- 1 tsp. cumin
- 1/2 tsp. turmeric
- 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper (optional)
- 2 tbsp. tomato paste
- 1 1/2 c. vegetable stock
- 3 c. mixed frozen veggies (peas, carrots, corn, green beans, etc)
- 1 1/2 c. cauliflower florets
- 3/4 c. cashews
- 1/2 c. golden raisins
- 1 1/2 c. extra-firm tofu, cubed
- 1/3 c. cream or 1 can coconut milk
- 1/2 tsp. garam masala
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1/3 c. chopped fresh cilantro

Note: feel free to add diced peppers, zucchini, eggplant, etc to the korma. If
you don’t have raisins, feel free to use pineapple tidbits. They are equally
delicious in this korma.

Heat a medium saucepan over medium heat. Once hot, add oil.

Add onions and sauté them until a nice, golden brown (about 15 to 20 minutes).
Once onions have browned, add the garlic and ginger. Sauté for a minute and then
add the cinnamon, cumin, cardamom, turmeric and cayenne. Toast the spices for a
minute and then add the tomato paste.

Slowly whisk in the vegetable stock and bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to
a simmer and add the cauliflower florets and frozen vegetable mixture. Allow the
vegetables to cook for about 15 minutes and soften. Season the dish with salt
and pepper.

Add the cashews, raisins, and tofu. Slowly stir in the cream or coconut milk.
Heat through.

Add the garam masala right before taking the korma off the heat.

Serve the korma with a cilantro garnish. Serve with basmati rice and/or garlic
naan.

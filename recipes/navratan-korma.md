# Navratan Korma

- 2 medium onions, finely chopped
- 3 tablespoons of canola oil
- 3 cloves of garlic, peeled and minced
- 1 teaspoon of fresh grated ginger
- 1/4 teaspoon of ground cardamom
- 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon
- 1 heaping teaspoon of ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric
- 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper (optional)
- 2 tablespoons of tomato paste
- 1 and 1/2 cups of vegetable stock
- 3 cups of mixed frozen veggies (peas, carrots, corn, green beans etc)
- 1 and 1/2 cups of cauliflower florets
- 3/4 cup of cashews
- 1/2 cup of golden raisins
- 1 and 1/2 cups of paneer (or extra-firm tofu; cubed)
- 1/3 cup of cream or 1 can of coconut milk
- 1/2 teaspoon of garam masala
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1/3 cup of chopped fresh cilantro or parsley (for garnish)

Note: feel free to add diced peppers, zucchini, eggplant etc to the
korma. If you don’t have raisins, feel free to use pineapple
tidbits. They are equally delicious in this korma.

Heat a medium saucepan over medium heat. Once hot, add oil.

Add onions and sauté them until a nice, golden brown (about 15 to 20
minutes). Once onions have browned, add the garlic and ginger. Sauté
for a minute and then add the cinnamon, cumin, cardamom, turmeric and
cayenne. Toast the spices for a minute and then add the tomato paste.

Slowly whisk in the vegetable stock and bring mixture to a
boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and add the cauliflower florets and
frozen vegetable mixture. Allow the vegetables to cook for about 15
minutes and soften. Season the dish with salt and pepper.

Add the cashews, raisins and paneer cheese. Slowly stir in the cream
or coconut milk. Heat through. Note: if the paneer is frozen, make
sure to thaw it before adding it to the korma. I normally place the
bag of frozen paneer in warm water for 15 minutes before adding it to
the korma. Works like a charm!

Add the garam masala right before taking the korma off the heat.

Serve the korma with a cilantro or parsley garnish. Serve with basmati
rice and/or garlic naan.

# Lasagna

- 1 box oven-ready lasagna noodles
- 1 c. grated Parmesan

For the cheese:

- 16 oz. ricotta
- 8 oz. shredded mozzarella
- 2 eggs

For the sauce:

- A few tablespoons of olive oil
- 2-3 cloves of garlic, chopped fine
- 1 white onion, diced
- 1 bell pepper, diced
- 1 zucchini, diced
- 2 carrots, diced
- Box of mushrooms, washed and chopped
- 2 jars of commercial pasta sauce
- Bag of spinach

Preheat oven to 375Â°F.

Saute the onion, pepper, zucchini, carrots, and garlic in a large saucepan with
the olive oil. Feel free to add some salt and pepper, cracked red pepper, or
oregano to taste. When the vegetables begin to soften add the mushrooms and cook
for another minute or two. Add both jars of pasta sauce and the whole bag of
spinach. Simmer for a few minutes until the spinach wilts.

While the sauce simmers, combine ricotta, mozzarella, and eggs and stir until
well mixed.

In a 13"x9" baking dish, add a ladle-full of sauce, then start layering noodles,
cheese, and sauce until all ingredients have been used up. Top with Parmesan.

Cover dish with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove from oven, remove foil, let
cool for a few minutes, and serve.

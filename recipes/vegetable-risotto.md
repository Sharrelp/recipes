# Vegetable Risotto

- 1 1/3 c. arborio rice
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 1 clove of garlic
- 1 red pepper
- 1 green pepper
- mushrooms
- peas
- parmesan cheese
- 1 1/2 pints vegetable stock

Chop up the onion, and saute it with the garlic, add in chopped
peppers and mushrooms and saute for a couple of minutes. Add in the
rice, along with a pinch of salt. Continue to saute for five minutes
and then add in the vegetable stock and the peas and cook slowly on a
low heat for half an hour/until the stock has reduced away. You can
use pretty much whatever vegetables you like, so you can try it out
with your favorites. A cheap and cheerful addition is to add in a tin
of chopped tomatoes just before you put in your vegetable stock (use
slightly less stock to compensate) or drain off a tin of baked beans
and add them in. You can even use a tin of vegetable soup along with
some stock for a richer taste. Traditional Italian recipes would add
in parmesan cheese, which is great for taste, but if you fancy adding
a little of your favorite cheese at this point and mixing it through
for a creamier taste, I think that works really well. Once the cheese
has been melted and stirred through you're ready to serve. Sprinkle a
bit of parmesan on the top and hey presto, a fine risotto.

# Pancakes

Makes about a dozen pancakes.

- 1 c. milk
- 2 tbsp. melted butter
- 1 large egg
- 1 tsp. vanilla extract
- 2 tbsp. sugar
- 2 tsp. baking powder
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1 c. flour

Mix everything in a mixing bowl and beat it all together. Add any extras---I
like about 3/4 c. of sliced almonds.


Spoon onto a griddle, cook until bubbly, then flip and cook for a couple more
minutes. Eat.

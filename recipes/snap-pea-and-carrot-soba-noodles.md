# Sugar Snap Pea and Carrot Soba Noodles

### Soba

- 6 oz. soba noodles
- 2 cups frozen edamame
- 10 oz. (about 3 cups) sugar snap peas or snow peas
- 6 medium-sized carrots, peeled
- 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro (about 2 handfuls)
- 1/4 cup sesame seeds

### Ginger-sesame sauce

- 1/4 cup tamari or soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons quality peanut oil or extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 small lime, juiced
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon honey or agave nectar
- 1 tablespoon white miso (optional)
- 2 teaspoons freshly grated ginger
- 1 teaspoon chili garlic sauce or sriracha

To prepare the vegetables: Slice the peas in half lengthwise (or just roughly
chop them). Slice the carrots into long, thin strips with a julienne peeler, or
slice them into ribbons with a vegetable peeler.

To make the sauce: whisk together the ingredients in a small bowl until
emulsified. Set aside.

Bring two big pots of water to a boil. Mwanwhile, toast the sesame seeds: Pour
the sesame seeds into a small pan. Toast for about 4 to 5 minutes over
medium-low heat, shaking the pan frequently to prevent burning, until the seeds
are turning golden and starting to make popping noises.

In one pot, cook the soba noodles just until al dente (probably about 5
minutes), then drain and briefly rinse under cool water. Cook the frozen edamame
in the other pot until warmed through (about 4 to 6 minutes) but before
draining, toss the halved peas into the boiling edamame water and cook for an
additional 20 seconds. Drain.

Combine the soba noodles, edamame, snap peas and carrots in a large serving
bowl. Pour in the dressing and toss. Toss in the chopped cilantro and toasted
sesame seeds. Serve.

# Sourdough Bread

This is a slightly modified version of King Arthur Flour's [Extra-Tangy
Sourdough][] recipe. Adding a bit more water and some additional gluten seem to
make for a better crumb, I think.

I reliably forget at least one step in this process unless I use a checklist, so
I've created a [sourdough checklist (PDF)][].

[sourdough checklist (PDF)]: ../documents/sourdough-checklist.pdf

- 1 c. ripe (fed) sourdough starter
- 1¾ c. lukewarm water
- 1 tbsp. vital wheat gluten (optional)
- 5 c. bread or all-purpose flour
- 1 tbsp. salt
- 2 tbsp. olive oil

Combine starter, water, gluten, and 3 c. flour. Mix.

Cover and let rest at room temperature for 4 hours.

Refrigerate overnight for about 12 hours.

Add the salt and remaining 2 c. flour. Knead to form a smooth dough.

Allow dough to rise for 4 hours, stretching and folding edges into the center
and turning every hour.

Divide dough in half. Shape dough into two oval loaves and place them on a
parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush with olive oil and let rise until puffy,
usually about 2–4 hours.

Preheat oven to 425°.

Optionally, fill a pan with water and place it on the bottom rack of the oven;
this fills the oven with steam and makes the crust chewier.

Spray the loaves with lukewarm water and/or slather on an extra coat of olive
oil.

Slash the loaves. Two diagonal slashes are fine.

Bake bread for 25–30 minutes (28 seems to work perfectly for us here in
Colorado) until it's a deep golden brown.

Remove from oven and cool on a rack.

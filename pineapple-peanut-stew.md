# African Pineapple Peanut Stew

* 1 cup chopped onions
* 2 garlic cloves, minced or pressed
* a tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 bunch kale or Swiss chard
* 2 cups undrained canned crushed pineapple (20-ounce can)
* 1/2 cup peanut butter
* 1 tbsp Tabasco sauce
* 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
* salt to taste

In a covered saucepan, saute the onions and garlic in the oil for
about 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until the onions are lightly
browned. While the onions saute, wash the kale or Swiss chard. Remove
and discard the large stems and any blemished leaves. Stack the leaves
on a cutting surface and slice crosswise into 1-inch-thick slices.

Add the pineapple and its juice to the onions and bring to a
simmer. Stir in the kale or chard, cover, and simmer for about 5
minutes, stirring a couple of times, until just tender. Mix in the
peanut butter, Tabasco, and cilantro and simmer for 5 minutes. Add
salt to taste, and serve.

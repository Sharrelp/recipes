# Apple Crisp

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 cups rolled oats
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
- 2 cups butter
- 10 Cortland apples, cored and sliced (or other "tart" apple)

Preheat oven to 350.

In a large bowl, combine the flour, oatmeal, cinnamon, nutmeg and
brown sugar. Cut butter into mixture until crumbly.

Take half of the mixture and pat it into the bottom of a 9x13 inch
baking dish.

Cover crumb mixture with apple slices, then sprinkle apple slices with
remaining crumb mixture. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45
to 50 minutes or until apples are tender.

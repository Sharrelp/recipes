# Sichuan-style Braised Eggplant

* Kosher salt
* 1 1/2 pounds Chinese or Japanese eggplants (about 3), trimmed, split
  into quarters lengthwise and cut into 3- to 4-inch lengths
* 2 red Thai bird chilies (or any small hot red chili)
* 3 tablespoons white vinegar or rice wine vinegar
* 2 tablespoons mirin (or Shaoxing wine or dry sherry)
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 2 teaspoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon rice vinegar (or Chinkiang vinegar or not-too-fancy
  balsamic vinegar)
* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 4 teaspoons minced fresh ginger
* 4 medium cloves minced garlic (about 4 teaspoons) (or garlic powder)
* 4 scallions, whites thinly sliced, greens cut into 1/3-inch segments
  (optional)
* 2 tablespoons Sichuan chili broad bean paste (Doubanjiang)
* Roughly chopped fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish (optional)
* 1 bag of spinach
* 1 bag of kale (optional)

Combine 1/2 cup kosher salt with 2 quarts water in a medium bowl. Add
eggplant pieces, skin-side up, and set aside to soak for at least 10
and up to 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat white vinegar in a small saucepan until simmering.
Place sliced chilies in a small bowl and pour hot vinegar on top. Let
rest for 5 minutes, then add wine, sugar, soy sauce, and Chinkiang
vinegar. Stirring constantly, add corn starch and stir until
dissolved. Set sauce aside. Drain eggplant carefully and pat dry with
paper towels.

Heat oil in a wok over high heat until smoking. Reduce heat to medium
add eggplant, and cook, tossing occasionally, until softened and well
browned on all sides. Push to sides of wok. Return wok to high heat
and add ginger, garlic, and scallions. Cook, stirring and tossing
constantly, until fragrant and raw bite is gone, about 30 seconds. Add
broad bean paste and cook, stirring for about 30 seconds. Pour in
chili sauce, making sure to scrape in any sugar or starch that may
have settled on the bottom. Add spinach and kale.

Cook, tossing constantly, until sauce is thickened, glossy, and coats
eggplants nicely, 1 to 3 minutes (if the sauce overthickens, thin with
a few tablespoons of water). Transfer to a serving bowl, garnish with
chopped fresh cilantro leaves, and serve immediately.

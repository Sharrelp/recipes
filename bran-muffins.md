# Double Bran Gem Muffins

- 1 c. wheat bran
- 1 c. oat bran
- 1 c. whole Wheat flour
- 2 tsp. baking powder
- 1 tsp. baking soda
- 1/2 tsp. cinnamon
- 2 large ripe bananas, mashed
- 2 egg whites, lightly beaten
- 1/2 c. skim milk
- 2 tbsp. olive oil
- squirt of honey

Line muffin pan with paper liners & preheat oven to 400. Combine all dry
ingredients. In separate bowl, combine liquid ingredients. Mix all together
until just combined. Scoop by 1/4 cups into pan. Bake 14-16 minutes or until
toothpick comes out sticky but clean. These really do not rise. I fill the cups
and just cook a little longer.

Can add fresh berries, chopped fruits and nuts. Granola. Try adding dried
cranberries - substitute orange juice for milk.
